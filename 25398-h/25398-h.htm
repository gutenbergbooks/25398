<h2><a name="Actus_Primus_Scena_Prima" id="Actus_Primus_Scena_Prima"></a><i>Actus Primus. Scena Prima.</i></h2>


<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Enter</i> Dinant, <i>a[n]d</i> Cleremont.</p></div>

<p>
<i>Din.</i> Disswade me not.<br />
<br />
<i>Clere.</i> It will breed a brawl.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> I care not, I wear a Sword.<br />
<br />
<i>Cler.</i> And wear discretion with it,<br />
Or cast it off, let that direct your arm,<br />
'Tis madness else, not valour, and more base<br />
Than to receive a wrong.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> Why would you have me<br />
Sit down with a disgrace, and thank the doer?<br />
We are not Stoicks, and that passive courage<br />
Is only now commendable in Lackies,<br />
Peasants, and Tradesmen, not in men of rank<br />
And qualitie, as I am.<br />
<br />
<i>Cler.</i> Do not cherish<br />
That daring vice, for which the whole age suffers.<br />
The blood of our bold youth, that heretofore<br />
Was spent in honourable action,<br />
Or to defend, or to enlarge the Kingdom,<br />
For the honour of our Country, and our Prince,<br />
Pours it self out with prodigal expence<br />
Upon our Mothers lap, the Earth that bred us<br />
For every trifle; and these private Duells,<br />
Which had their first original from the <i>Fr[enc]h</i><br />
(And for which, to this day, we are justly censured)<br />
Are banisht from all civil Governments:<br />
Scarce three in <i>Venice</i>, in as many years;<br />
In <i>Florence</i>, they are rarer, and in all<br />
The fair Dominions of the <i>Spanish</i> King,<br />
They are never heard of: Nay, those neighbour Countries,<br />
Which gladly imitate our other follies,<br />
And come at a dear rate to buy them of us,<br />
Begin now to detest them.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> Will you end yet&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Cler.</i> And I have heard that some of our late Kings,<br />
For the lie, wearing of a Mistris favour,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>A cheat at Cards or Dice, and such like causes,<br />
Have lost as many gallant Gentlemen,<br />
As might have met the great <i>Turk</i> in the field<br />
With confidence of a glorious Victorie,<br />
And shall we then&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> No more, for shame no more,<br />
Are you become a Patron too? 'tis a new one,<br />
No more on't, burn't, give it to some Orator,<br />
To help him to enlarge his exercise,<br />
With such a one it might do well, and profit<br />
The Curat of the Parish, but for <i>Cleremont</i>,<br />
The bold, and undertaking <i>Cleremont</i>,<br />
To talk thus to his friend, his friend that knows him,<br />
<i>Dinant</i> that knows his <i>Cleremont</i>, is absurd,<br />
And meer Apocrypha.<br />
<br />
<i>Cler.</i> Why, what know you of me?<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> Why if thou hast forgot thy self, I'le tell thee,<br />
And not look back, to speak of what thou wert<br />
At fifteen, for at those years I have heard<br />
Thou wast flesh'd, and enter'd bravely.<br />
<br />
<i>Cler.</i> Well Sir, well.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> But yesterday, thou wast the common second,<br />
Of all that only knew thee, thou hadst bills<br />
Set up on every post, to give thee notice<br />
Where any difference was, and who were parties;<br />
And as to save the charges of the Law<br />
Poor men seek arbitrators, thou wert chosen<br />
By such as knew thee not, to compound quarrels:<br />
But thou wert so delighted with the sport,<br />
That if there were no just cause, thou wouldst make one,<br />
Or be engag'd thy self: This goodly calling<br />
Thou hast followed five and twenty years, and studied<br />
The Criticismes of contentions, and art thou<br />
In so few hours transform'd? certain this night<br />
Thou hast had strange dreams, or rather visions.<br />
<br />
<i>Clere.</i> Yes, Sir,<br />
I have seen fools, and fighters, chain'd together,<br />
And the Fighters had the upper hand, and whipt first,<br />
The poor Sots laughing at 'em. What I have been<br />
It skils not, what I will be is resolv'd on.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span><i>Din.</i> Why then you'l fight no more?<br />
<br />
<i>Cler.</i> Such is my purpose.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> On no occasion?<br />
<br />
<i>Cler.</i> There you stagger me.<br />
Some kind of wrongs there are which flesh and blood<br />
Cannot endure.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> Thou wouldst not willingly<br />
Live a protested coward, or be call'd one?<br />
<br />
<i>Cler.</i> Words are but words.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> Nor wouldst thou take a blow?<br />
<br />
<i>Cler.</i> Not from my friend, though drunk, and from an enemy<br />
I think much less.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> There's some hope of thee left then,<br />
Wouldst thou hear me behind my back disgrac'd?<br />
<br />
<i>Cler.</i> Do you think I am a rogue? they that should do it<br />
Had better been born dumb.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> Or in thy presence<br />
See me o'recharg'd with odds?<br />
<br />
<i>Cler.</i> I'd fall my self first.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> Would'st thou endure thy Mistris be taken from thee,<br />
And thou sit quiet?<br />
<br />
<i>Cler.</i> There you touch my honour,<br />
No French-man can endure that.<br />
<br />
<i>Di[n].</i> Pl&mdash;&mdash; upon thee,<br />
Why dost thou talk of Peace then? that dar'st suffer<br />
Nothing, or in thy self, or in thy friend<br />
That is unmanly?<br />
<br />
<i>Cler.</i> That I grant, I cannot:<br />
But I'le not quarrel with this Gentleman<br />
For wearing stammel Breeches, or this Gamester<br />
For playing a thousand pounds, that owes me nothing;<br />
For this mans taking up a common Wench<br />
In raggs, and lowsie, then maintaining her<br />
Caroach'd in cloth of Tissue, nor five hundred<br />
Of such like toyes, that at no part concern me;<br />
Marry, where my honour, or my friend is questioned,<br />
I have a Sword, and I think I may use it<br />
To the cutting of a Rascals throat, or so,<br />
Like a good Christian.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> Thou art of a fine Religion,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>And rather than we'l make a Schism in friendship<br />
I will be of it: But to be serious,<br />
Thou art acquainted with my tedious love-suit<br />
To fair <i>Lamira</i>?<br />
<br />
<i>Cler.</i> Too well Sir, and remember<br />
Your presents, courtship, that's too good a name,<br />
Your slave-like services, your morning musique;<br />
Your walking three hours in the rain at midnight,<br />
To see her at her window, sometimes laugh'd at,<br />
Sometimes admitted, and vouchsaf'd to kiss<br />
Her glove, her skirt, nay, I have heard, her slippers,<br />
How then you triumph'd?<br />
Here was love forsooth.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> These follies I deny not,<br />
Such a contemptible thing my dotage made me,<br />
But my reward for this&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Cler.</i> As you deserv'd,<br />
For he that makes a goddess of a Puppet,<br />
Merits no other recompence.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> This day friend,<br />
For thou art so&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Cler.</i> I am no flatterer.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> This proud, ingratefull she, is married to<br />
Lame <i>Champernel</i>.<br />
<br />
<i>Cler.</i> I know him, he has been<br />
As tall a Sea-man, and has thriv'd as well by't,<br />
The loss of a legg and an arm deducted, as any<br />
That ever put from <i>Marseilles</i>: you are tame,<br />
Pl&mdash;&mdash; on't, it mads me; if it were my case,<br />
I should kill all the family.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> Yet but now<br />
You did preach patience.<br />
<br />
<i>Cler.</i> I then came from confession,<br />
And 'twas enjoyn'd me three hours for a penance,<br />
To be a peaceable man, and to talk like one,<br />
But now, all else being pardon'd, I begin<br />
On a new Tally, Foot do any thing,<br />
I'le second you.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> I would not willingly<br />
Make red, my yet white conscience, yet I purpose<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>In the open street, as they come from the Temple,<br />
(For this way they must pass,) to speak my wrongs,<br />
And do it boldly.                             <span style="margin-left: 15em;">[<i>Musick playes.</i></span><br />
<br />
<i>Cler.</i> Were thy tongue a Cannon,<br />
I would stand by thee, boy, they come, upon 'em.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> Observe a little first.<br />
<br />
<i>Cler.</i> This is fine fidling.<br />

<p>
<i>Din.</i> Stand by, for I'le be heard.<br />
<br />
<i>Verta.</i> This is strange rudeness.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> 'Tis courtship, ballanced with injuries,<br />
You all look pale with guilt, but I will dy<br />
Your cheeks with blushes, if in your sear'd veins<br />
There yet remain so much of honest blood<br />
To make the colour; first to ye my Lord,<br />
The Father of this Bride, whom you have sent<br />
Alive into her grave.<br />
<br />
<i>Champ.</i> How? to her grave?<br />
<br />
<i>Dina.</i> Be patient Sir, I'le speak of you anon<br />
You that allow'd me liberal access,<br />
To make my way with service, and approv'd of<br />
My birth, my person, years, and no base fortune:<br />
You that are rich, and but in this held wise too,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>That as a Father should have look'd upon<br />
Your Daughter in a husband, and aim'd more<br />
At what her youth, and heat of blood requir'd<br />
In lawfull pleasures, than the parting from<br />
Your Crowns to pay her dowr: you that already<br />
Have one foot in the grave, yet study profit,<br />
As if you were assur'd to live here ever;<br />
What poor end had you, in this choice? in what<br />
Deserve I your contempt? my house, and honours<br />
At all parts equal yours, my fame as fair,<br />
And not to praise my self, the City ranks me<br />
In the first file of her most hopefull Gentry:<br />
But <i>Champernel</i> is rich, and needs a nurse,<br />
And not your gold: and add to that, he's old too,<br />
His whole estate in likelihood to descend<br />
Upon your Family; Here was providence,<br />
I grant, but in a Nobleman base thrift:<br />
No Merchants, nay, no Pirats, sell for Bondmen<br />
Their Country-men, but you, a Gentleman,<br />
To save a little gold, have sold your Daughter<br />
To worse than slaverie.<br />
<br />
<i>Cler.</i> This was spoke home indeed.<br />
<br />
<i>Beau.</i> Sir, I shall take some other time to tell you,<br />
That this harsh language was delivered to<br />
An old man, but my Father.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> At your pleasure.<br />
<br />
<i>Cler.</i> Proceed in your design, let me alone,<br />
To answer him, or any man.<br />
<br />
<i>Verd.</i> You presume<br />
Too much upon your name, but may be couzen'd.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> But for you, most unmindfull of my service,<br />
For now I may upbraid you, and with honour,<br />
Since all is lost, and yet I am a gainer,<br />
In being deliver'd from a torment in you,<br />
For such you must have been, you to whom nature<br />
Gave with a liberal hand most excellent form,<br />
Your education, language, and discourse,<br />
And judgement to distinguish, when you shall<br />
With feeling sorrow understand how wretched<br />
And miserable you have made your self,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>And but your self have nothing to accuse,<br />
Can you with hope from any beg compassion?<br />
But you will say, you serv'd your Fathers pleasure,<br />
Forgetting that unjust commands of Parents<br />
Are not to be obey'd, or that you are rich,<br />
And that to wealth all pleasure else are servants,<br />
Yet but consider, how this wealth was purchas'd,<br />
'Twill trouble the possession.<br />
<br />
<i>Champ.</i> You Sir know<br />
I got it, and with honour.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> But from whom?<br />
Remember that, and how: you'l come indeed<br />
To houses bravely furnish'd, but demanding<br />
Where it was bought, this Souldier will not lie,<br />
But answer truly, this rich cloth of Arras<br />
I made my prize in such a Ship, this Plate<br />
Was my share in another; these fair Jewels,<br />
Coming a shore, I got in such a Village,<br />
The Maid, or Matron kill'd, from whom they were ravish'd,<br />
The Wines you drink are guilty too, for this,<br />
This <i>Candie</i> Wine, three Merchants were undone,<br />
These Suckets break as many more: in brief,<br />
All you shall wear, or touch, or see, is purchas'd<br />
By lawless force, and you but revel in<br />
The tears, and grones of such as were the owners.<br />
<br />
<i>Champ.</i> 'Tis false, most basely false.<br />
<br />
<i>Verta.</i> Let losers talk.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> Lastly, those joyes, those best of joyes, which <i>Hymen</i><br />
Freely bestows on such, that come to tye<br />
The sacred knot be blesses, won unto it<br />
By equal love, and mutual affection,<br />
Not blindly led with the desire of riches,<br />
Most miserable you shall never taste of.<br />
This Marriage night you'l meet a Widows bed,<br />
Or failing of those pleasures all Brides look for,<br />
Sin in your wish it were so.<br />
<br />
<i>Champ.</i> Thou art a Villain,<br />
A base, malitious slanderer.<br />
<br />
<i>Cler.</i> Strike him.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> No, he is not worth a blow.<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span><i>Champ.</i> O that I had thee<br />
In some close vault, that only would yield room<br />
To me to use my Sword, to thee no hope<br />
To run away, I would make thee on thy knees,<br />
Bite out the tongue that wrong'd me.<br />
<br />
<i>Verta.</i> Pray you have patience.<br />
<br />
<i>Lamira.</i> This day I am to be your Soveraign,<br />
Let me command you.<br />
<br />
<i>Champ.</i> I am lost with rage,<br />
And know not what I am my self, nor you:<br />
Away, dare such as you, that love the smoke<br />
Of peace more than the fire of glorious War,<br />
And like unprofitable drones, feed on<br />
Your grandsires labours, that, as I am now,<br />
Were gathering Bees, and fill'd their Hive, this Country<br />
With brave triumphant spoils, censure our actions?<br />
You object my prizes to me, had you seen<br />
The horrour of a Sea-fight, with what danger<br />
I made them mine; the fire I fearless fought in,<br />
And quench'd it in mine enemies blood, which straight<br />
Like oyle pour'd out on't, made it burn anew;<br />
My Deck blown up, with noise enough to mock<br />
The lowdest thunder, and the desperate fools<br />
That Boorded me, sent, to defie the tempests<br />
That were against me, to the angrie Sea,<br />
Frighted with men thrown o're; no victory,<br />
But in despight of the four Elements,<br />
The Fire, the Air, the Sea, and sands hid in it<br />
To be atchiev'd, you would confess poor men,<br />
(Though hopeless, such an honourable way<br />
To get or wealth, or honour) in your selves<br />
He that through all these dreadfull passages<br />
Pursued and overtook them, unaffrighted,<br />
Deserves reward, and not to have it stil'd<br />
By the base name of theft.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> This is the Courtship,<br />
That you must look for, Madam.<br />
<br />
<i>Cler.</i> 'Twill do well,<br />
When nothing can be done, to spend the night with:<br />
Your tongue is sound good Lord, and I could wish<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>For this young Ladyes sake this leg, this arm,<br />
And there is something else, I will not name,<br />
(Though 'tis the only thing that must content her)<br />
Had the same vigour.<br />
<br />
<i>Champ.</i> You shall buy these scoffs<br />
With your best blood: help me once noble anger,<br />
(Nay stir not, I alone must right my self)<br />
And with one leg transport me, to correct<br />
These scandalous praters: O that noble wounds      <span style="margin-left: 6em;">[<i>Falls.</i></span><br />
Should hinder just revenge! D'ye jear me too?<br />
I got these, not as you do, your diseases<br />
In Brothels, or with riotous abuse<br />
Of wine in Taverns; I have one leg shot,<br />
One arm disabled, and am honour'd more,<br />
By losing them, as I did, in the face<br />
Of a brave enemy, than if they were<br />
As when I put to Sea; you are <i>French-men</i> only,<br />
In that you have been laied, and cur'd, goe to:<br />
You mock my leg, but every bone about you,<br />
Makes you good Almanack-makers, to foretell<br />
What weather we shall have.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> Put up your Sword.<br />
<br />
<i>Cler.</i> Or turn it to a Crutch, there't may b[e] usefull,<br />
And live on the relation to your Wife<br />
Of what a brave man you were once.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> And tell her,<br />
What a fine vertue 'tis in a young Lady<br />
To give an old man pap.<br />
<br />
<i>Cler.</i> Or hire a Surgeon<br />
To teach her to roul up your broken limbs.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> To make a Pultess, and endure the scent<br />
Of oils, and nasty Plasters.<br />
<br />
<i>Verta.</i> Fie Sir, fie,<br />
You that have stood all dangers of all kinds, to<br />
Yield to a Rivalls scoffe?<br />
<br />
<i>Lamira.</i> Shed tears upon<br />
Your Wedding day? this is unmanly Gentlemen.<br />
<br />
<i>Champ.</i> They are tears of anger: O that I should live<br />
To play the woman thus! All powerfull heaven,<br />
Restore me, but one hour, that strength again,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>That I had once, to chastise in these men<br />
Their folies, and ill manners, and that done,<br />
When you please, I'le yield up the fort of life,<br />
And do it gladly.<br />

And I will do it nobly, or disclaim me.<br />

<i>Beaup.</i> I say no more, you have a Brother, Sister,<br />
This is your wedding day, we are in the street,<br />
And howsoever they forget their honour,<br />
'Tis fit I lose not mine, by their example.<br />
<br />

This insolent affront.<br />
<br />

Nor care not what they are. Is the[re] ought else<br />
That you would say;<br />
<br />

Ne'r know me more, Cousin <i>Beaupre</i>.<br />
<br />
<i>Champ.</i> Repent not<br />
What thou hast done, my life, thou shalt not find<br />
I am decrepit; in my love and service,<br />
I will be young, and constant, and believe me,<br />
For thou shalt find it true, in scorn of all<br />
The scandals these rude men have thrown upon me<br />
I'le meet thy pleasures with a young mans ardour,<br />
And in all circumstances of a Husband,<br />
Perform my part.<br />
<br />
<i>Lamira.</i> Good Sir, I am your servant,<br />
And 'tis too late now, if I did repent,<br />
(Which as I am a virgin yet, I do not)<br />
To undoe the knot, that by the Church is tyed.<br />
Only I would beseech ye, as you have<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>A good opinion of me, and my vertues,<br />
For so you have pleas'd to stile my innocent weakness,<br />
That what hath pass'd be[t]ween <i>Dinant</i> and me,<br />
Or what now in your hearing he hath spoken,<br />
Beget not doubts, or fears.<br />
<br />
<i>Champ.</i> I apprehend you,<br />
You think I will be jealous; as I live<br />
Thou art mistaken sweet; and to confirm it<br />
Discourse with whom thou wilt, ride where thou wilt,<br />
Feast whom thou wilt, as often as thou wilt,<br />
For I will have no other guards upon thee<br />
Than thine own thoughts.<br />
<br />
<i>Lamira.</i> I'le use this liberty<br />
With moderation Sir.<br />
<br />
<i>Beaup.</i> I am resolv'd.<br />
Steal off, I'le follow you.<br />

Till you find cause, which I shall never give,<br />
Dislike not of your Son in Law.<br />

The language I should use; I am most happy<br />
In being so near you.      <span style="margin-left: 12em;">[<i>Exeunt</i> Verdone, <i>and</i> Beaupre.</span><br />

<br />
<i>Cler.</i> Why we must fight, I know it, and I long for't,<br />
It was apparent in the fiery eye<br />
Of young <i>Verdone</i>, <i>Beaupre</i> look'd pale and shook too,<br />
Familiar signs of anger. They are both brave fellows<br />
Tri'd and approv'd, and I am proud to encounter<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>With men, from whom no honour can be lost;<br />
They will play up to a man, and set him off.<br />
When e're I go to the field, heaven keep me from<br />
The meeting of an unflesh'd youth or, Coward,<br />
The first, to get a name, comes on too hot,<br />
The Coward is so swift in giving ground,<br />
There is no overtaking him without<br />
A hunting Nag, well breath'd too.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> All this while,<br />
You ne'r think on the danger.<br />
<br />
<i>Cler.</i> Why 'tis no more<br />
Than meeting of a dozen friends at Supper,<br />
And drinking hard; mischief comes there unlook'd for,<br />
I am sure as suddain, and strikes home as often,<br />
For this we are prepar'd.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> <i>Lamira</i> Loves<br />
Her Brother <i>Beaupre</i> dearly.<br />
<br />
<i>Cler.</i> What of that?<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> And should he call me to account for what<br />
But now I spake, nor can I with mine honour<br />
Recant my words, that little hope is left me,<br />
E're to enjoy what (next to Heaven) I long for,<br />
Is taken from me.<br />
<br />

She being now married?<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> Oh my <i>Cleremont</i>,<br />
To you all secrets of my heart lye open,<br />
And I rest most secure that whatsoe're<br />
I lock up there, is as a private thought,<br />
And will no farther wrong me. I am a <i>French-man</i>,<br />
And for the greater part we are born Courtiers,<br />
She is a woman, and however yet,<br />
No heat of service had the power to melt<br />
Her frozen Chastity, time and opportunitie<br />
May work her to my ends, I confess ill ones,<br />
And yet I must pursue 'em: now her marriage,<br />
In probabilitie, will no way hurt,<br />
But rather help me.<br />
<br />
<i>Cler.</i> Sits the wind there? pray you tell me<br />
How far off dwells your love from lust?<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span><i>Din.</i> Too near,<br />
But prethee chide me not.<br />
<br />
<i>Cler.</i> Not I, goe on boy,<br />
I have faults my self, and will not reprehend<br />
A crime I am not free from: for her Marriage,<br />
I do esteem it (and most batchellors are<br />
Of my opinion) as a fair protection,<br />
To play the wanton without loss of honour.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> Would she make use of't so, I were most happy.<br />
<br />
<i>Cler.</i> No more of this. Judge now,<br />
Whether I have the gift of prophecie.<br />

To be known better to you.<br />
<br />
<i>Cler.</i> My desires<br />
Embrace your wishes Sir.<br />
<br />
<i>Beaup.</i> Sir, I have ever<br />
Esteem'd you truly noble, and profess<br />
I should have been most proud, to have had the honour<br />
To call you Brother, but my Fathers pleasure<br />
Denied that happiness. I know no man lives,<br />
That can command his passions, and therefore<br />
Dare not condemn the late intemperate language<br />
You were pleas'd to use to my Father and my Sister,<br />
He's old and she a woman, I most sorrie<br />
My honour does compel me to entreat you,<br />
To do me the favour, with your sword to meet me<br />
A mile without the Citie.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> You much honour me.<br />
In the demand, I'le gladly wait upon you.<br />

<br />

I think there is no Nation under Heaven<br />
That cut their enemies throats with complement,<br />
And such fine tricks as we do: If you have<br />
Any few Prayers to say, this night you may<br />
Call 'em to mind and use 'em, for my self,<br />
As I have little to lose, my care is less,<br />
So till to morrow morning I bequeath you<br />
To your devotions; and those paid, but use<br />
That noble courage I have seen, and we<br />
Shall fight, as in a Castle.<br />
<br />

Thy resolution would steel a Coward,<br />
And I most fortunate in such a Friend;<br />
All tenderness and nice respect of woman<br />
Be now far from me, reputation take<br />
A full possession of my heart, and prove<br />

By your Ladiships cheerfull looks I well perceive<br />
That this night the good Lord hath been<br />
At an unusual service, and no wonder<br />
If he rest after it.<br />
<br />
<i>Lamira.</i> You are very bold.<br />
<br />

Sadness to me's a stranger, your good pardon<br />
If I speak like a fool, I could have wisht<br />
To have ta'ne your place to night, had bold <i>Dinant</i><br />
Your first and most obsequious servant tasted<br />
Those delicates, which by his lethargie<br />

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Enter</i> Nurse.</p></div>

<p>
<i>Nurse.</i> O Ladie dreadfull ones.<br />
They are to fight this morning, there's no remedie.<br />
I saw my Lord your Brother, and <i>Verdone</i><br />
Take horse as I came by.<br />
<br />
<i>Lamira.</i> Where's <i>Cleremont</i>?<br />
<br />
<i>Nurse.</i> I met him too, and mounted.<br />
<br />
<i>Lamira.</i> Where's <i>Dinant</i>?<br />
<br />
<i>Nurse.</i> There's all the hope, I have staid him with a trick,<br />
If I have done well so.<br />
<br />
<i>Lamira.</i> What trick?<br />
<br />
<i>Nurse.</i> I told him,<br />
Your Ladiship laid your command upon him,<br />
To attend you presently, and to confirm it,<br />
Gave him the ring he oft hath seen you wear,<br />
That you bestowed on me: he waits without<br />
Disguis'd, and if you have that power in him,<br />
As I presume you have, it is in you<br />
To stay or alter him.<br />
<br />
<i>Lamira.</i> Have you learnt the place,<br />
Where they are to encounter?<br />
<br />
<i>Nurse.</i> Yes 'tis where<br />
The Duke of <i>Burgundie</i> met <i>Lewis</i> th' eleventh.<br />
<br />
<i>Lamir.</i> Enough, I will reward thee liberally,      <span style="margin-left: 8em;">[<i>Exit</i> Nurse.</span><br />
Goe bring him in: full dear I loved <i>Dinant</i>,<br />
While it was lawfull, but those fires are quench'd<br />
I being now anothers, truth forgive me<br />
And let dissimulation be no crime,<br />
Though most unwillingly I put it on<br />
To guard a Brothers safetie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Enter</i> Dinant.</p></div>

<p>
<i>Din.</i> Now your pleasure,<br />
Though ill you have deserv'd it, you perceive<br />
I am still your fool, and cannot but obey<br />
What ever you command.<br />
<br />
<i>Lamira.</i> You speak, as if<br />
You did repent it, and 'tis not worth my thanks then,<br />
But there has been a time, in which you would<br />
Receive this as a favour.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> Hope was left then<br />
Of recompence.<br />
<br />
<i>Lamira.</i> Why I am still <i>Lamira</i>,<br />
And you <i>Dinant</i>, and 'tis yet in my power,<br />
I dare not say I'le put it into act,<br />
To reward your love and service.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> There's some comfort.<br />
<br />
<i>Lami.</i> But think not that so low I prize my fame,<br />
To give it up to any man that refuses<br />
To buy it, or with danger of performance<br />
Of what I shall enjoin him.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> Name that danger<br />
Be it of what horrid shape soever Ladie<br />
Which I will shrink at; only at this instant<br />
Be speedie in't.<br />
<br />
<i>Lamira.</i> I'le put you to the trial:<br />
You shall not fight to day, do you start at that?<br />
Not with my Brother, I have heard your difference,<br />
Mine is no <i>Helens</i> beauty to be purchas'd<br />
With blood, and so defended, if you look for<br />
Favours from me, deserve them with obedience,<br />
There's no way else to gain 'em.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> You command<br />
What with mine honour I cannot obey,<br />
Which lies at pawn against it, and a friend<br />
Equally dear as that, or life, engag'd,<br />
Not for himself, but me.<br />
<br />
<i>Lamira.</i> Why, foolish man,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>Dare you solicite me to serve your lust,<br />
In which not only I abuse my Lord,<br />
My Father, and my family, but write whore,<br />
Though not upon my forehead, in my conscience,<br />
To be read hourly, and yet name your honour?<br />
Yours suffers but in circumstance; mine in substance.<br />
If you obey me, you part with some credit,<br />
From whom? the giddy multitude; but mankind<br />
Will censure me, and justly.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> I will lose,<br />
What most I do desire, rather than hazard<br />
So dear a friend, or write my self a coward,<br />
'Tis better be no man.<br />
<br />
<i>Lamira.</i> This will not do;<br />
Why, I desire not, you should be a coward,<br />
Nor do I weigh my Brothers life with yours,<br />
Meet him, fight with him, do, and kill him fairly,<br />
Let me not suffer for you, I am careless.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> Suffer for me?<br />
<br />
<i>Lamira.</i> For you, my kindness to you<br />
Already brands me with a strumpets name.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> O that I knew the wretch!<br />
<br />
<i>Lamira.</i> I will not name him,<br />
Nor give you any Character to know him;<br />
But if you dare, and instantly ride forth<br />
At the west port of the City, and defend there<br />
My reputation, against all you meet,<br />
For two hours only, I'le not swear <i>Dinant</i>,<br />
To satisfie, (though sure I think I shall)<br />
What ever you desire, if you denie this,<br />
Be desperate, for willingly, by this light,<br />
I'le never see thee more.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> Two hours, do you say?<br />
<br />
<i>Lamira.</i> Only two hours.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> I were no Gentleman,<br />
Should I make scruple of it; this favour arms me,<br />
And boldly I'll perform it.                              <span style="margin-left: 12em;">[<i>Exit.</i></span><br />
<br />
<i>Lamira.</i> I am glad on't.<br />
This will prevent their meeting yet, and keep<br />
My Brother safe, which was the mark I shot at.           <span style="margin-left: 4em;">[<i>Exit.</i></span><br />

<i>Cham.</i> All disgraces wretch.<br />
<br />
<i>Lam.</i> Good Sir be patient.<br />
<br />
<i>Cham.</i> Was there no tree,<br />
(For to fall by a noble enemies sword,<br />
A Coward is unworthy) nor no River,<br />
To force thy life out backward or to drown it,<br />
But that thou must survive thy i[n]famie?<br />
And kill me with the sight of one I hate,<br />
And gladly would forget?<br />
<br />
<i>Beaup.</i> Sir, his misfortune<br />
Deserves not this reproof.<br />
<br />
<i>Cham.</i> In your opinion,<br />
'Tis fit you two should be of one belief,<br />
You are indeed fine gallants, and fight bravely<br />
I'th' City with your tongues, but in the field<br />
Have neither spirit to dare nor power to do,<br />
Your swords are all lead there.<br />
<br />
<i>Beaup.</i> I know no duty,<br />
(How ever you may wreak your spleen on him,)<br />
That bindes me to endure this.<br />
<br />
<i>Cham.</i> From <i>Dinant</i><br />
You'l suffer more; that ever cursed I,<br />
Should give my honour up, to the defence<br />
Of such a thing as he is, or my Lady<br />
That is all Innocent, for whom a dove would<br />
Assume the courage of a daring Eagle,<br />
Repose her confidence in one that can<br />
No better guard her. In contempt of you<br />
I love <i>Dinant</i>, mine enemy, nay admire him,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>His valour claims it from me, and with justice,<br />
He that could fight thus, in a cause not honest,<br />
His sword edg'd with defence of right and honour,<br />
Would pierce as deep as lightning, with that speed too,<br />
And kill as deadly.<br />
<br />
<i>Verd.</i> You are as far from justice<br />
In him you praise, as equitie in the censure<br />
You load me with.<br />
<br />
<i>Beaup.</i> <i>Dinant?</i> he durst not meet us.<br />
<br />
<i>Lam.</i> How? durst not, Brother?<br />
<br />
<i>Beaup.</i> Durst not, I repeat it.<br />
<br />
<i>Verd.</i> Nor was it <i>Cleremont</i>'s valour that disarm'd us,<br />
I had the better of him; for <i>Dinant</i>,<br />
If that might make my peace with you, I dare<br />
Write him a Coward upon every post,<br />
And with the hazard of my life defend it.<br />
<br />
<i>Lam.</i> If 'twere laid at the stake you'd lose it, Nephew.<br />
<br />
<i>Cham.</i> Came he not, say you?<br />
<br />
<i>Verd.</i> No, but in his room,<br />
There was a Devil, hir'd from some Magician<br />
I'th' shape of an Atturney.<br />
<br />
<i>Beau.</i> 'Twas he did it.<br />
<br />
<i>Verd.</i> And his the honour.<br />
<br />
<i>Beau.</i> I could wish <i>Dinant</i>&mdash;<br />
But what talk I of one that stept aside,<br />
And durst not come?<br />
<br />
<i>Lam.</i> I am such a friend to truth,<br />
I cannot hear this: why do you detract<br />
Thus poorly (I should say to others basely)<br />
From one of such approv'd worth?<br />
<br />
<i>Cham.</i> Ha! how's this?<br />
<br />
<i>Lam.</i> From one so excellent in all that's noble,<br />
Whose only weakness is excess of courage?<br />
That knows no enemies, that he cannot master,<br />
But his affections, and in them, the worst<br />
His love to me.<br />
<br />
<i>Cham.</i> To you?<br />
<br />
<i>Lam.</i> Yes, Sir, to me,<br />
I dare (for what is that which Innocence dares not)<br />
To you profess it: and he shun'd not the Combat<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>For fear or doubt of these: blush and repent,<br />
That you in thought e're did that wrong to valour.<br />
<br />
<i>Beaup.</i> Why, this is rare.<br />
<br />
<i>Cham.</i> 'Fore heaven, exceeding rare;<br />
Why modest Lady, you that sing such Encomiums<br />
Of your first Suiter&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Verd.</i> How can ye convince us<br />
In your reports?<br />
<br />
<i>Lam.</i> With what you cannot answer,<br />
'Twas my command that staid him.<br />
<br />
<i>Cham.</i> Your command?<br />
<br />
<i>Lam.</i> Mine, Sir, and had my will rank'd with my power,<br />
And his obedience, I could have sent him<br />
With more ease, weaponless to you, and bound,<br />
Than have kept him back, so well he loves his honour<br />
Beyond his life.<br />
<br />
<i>Cham.</i> Better, and better still.<br />
<br />
<i>Lam.</i> I wrought with him in private to divert him<br />
From your assur'd destruction, had he met you.<br />
<br />
<i>Cham.</i> In private?<br />
<br />
<i>Lam.</i> Yes, and us'd all Arts, all Charms<br />
Of one that knew her self the absolute Mistris<br />
Of all his faculties.<br />
<br />
<i>Cham.</i> Gave all rewards too<br />
His service could deserve; did not he take<br />
The measure of my sheets?<br />
<br />
<i>Lam.</i> Do not look yellow,<br />
I have cause to speak; frowns cannot fright me,<br />
By all my hopes, as I am spotless to you,<br />
If I rest once assur'd you do but doubt me,<br />
Or curb me of that freedom you once gave me&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Cham.</i> What then?<br />
<br />
<i>Lam.</i> I'le not alone abuse your bed, that's nothing,<br />
But to your more vexation, 'tis resolv'd on,<br />
I'le run away, and then try if <i>Dinant</i><br />
Have courage to defend me.<br />
<br />
<i>Champ.</i> Impudent!<br />
<br />
<i>Verd.</i> And on the sudden&mdash;<br />
<br />
<i>Beau.</i> How are ye transform'd<br />
From what you were?<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span><i>Lam.</i> I was an innocent Virgin,<br />
And I can truly swear, a Wife as pure<br />
As ever lay by Husband, and will dy so,<br />
Let me live unsuspected, I am no servant,<br />
Nor will be us'd like one: If you desire<br />
To keep me constant as I would be, let<br />
Trust and belief in you beget and nurse it;<br />
Unnecessary jealousies make more whores<br />
Than all baits else laid to entrap our frailties.<br />
<br />
<i>Beau.</i> There's no contesting with her, from a child<br />
Once mov'd, she hardly was to be appeas'd,<br />
Yet I dare swear her honest.<br />
<br />
<i>Cham.</i> So I think too,<br />
On better judgement: I am no Italian<br />
To lock her up; nor would I be a Dutchman,<br />
To have my Wife, my soveraign, to command me:<br />
I'le try the gentler way, but if that fail,<br />
Believe it, Sir, there's nothing but extreams<br />
Which she must feel from me.<br />
<br />
<i>Beau.</i> That, as you please, Sir.<br />
<br />
<i>Charl.</i> You have won the breeches, Madam, look up sweetly,<br />
My Lord limps toward you.<br />
<br />
<i>Lam.</i> You will learn more manners.<br />
<br />
<i>Charl.</i> This is a fee, for counsel that's unask'd for.<br />
<br />
<i>Cham.</i> Come, I mistook thee sweet, prethee forgive me,<br />
I never will be jealous: e're I cherish<br />
Such a mechanick humour, I'le be nothing;<br />
I'le say, <i>Dinant</i> is all that thou wouldst have him,<br />
Will that suffice?<br />
<br />
<i>Lam.</i> 'Tis well, Sir.<br />
<br />
<i>Cham.</i> Use thy freedom<br />
Uncheck'd, and unobserv'd, if thou wilt have it,<br />
These shall forget their honour, I my wrongs.<br />
We'll all dote on him, hell be my reward<br />
If I dissemble.<br />
<br />
<i>Lam.</i> And that hell take me<br />
If I affect him, he's a lustfull villain,<br />
(But yet no coward) and sollicites me<br />
To my dishonour, that's indeed a quarrel,<br />
And truly mine, which I will so revenge,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>As it shall fright such as dare only think<br />
To be adulterers.<br />
<br />

I give up all to thee.<br />

Till you come to the matter be not rapt thus,<br />
Walk in, walk in, I am your scout for once,<br />
You owe me the like service.<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
<i>Cler.</i> Why, do it in dumb shew then, I am silenc'd.<br />
<br />
<i>Lam.</i> Be not so hasty, Sir, the golden Apples<br />
Had a fell Dragon for their Guard, your pleasures<br />
Are to be attempted with <i>Herculean</i> danger,<br />
Or never to be gotten.<br />
<br />

Each Night, he only sleeps.<br />

<br />

He only stretches out his hand and feels,<br />

He sleeps again; but should he miss me, Valour<br />
Could not defend our lives.<br />

Command and boldly.<br />
<br />

You must lye with my Lord.<br />
<br />

Two Beards together, that's preposterous.<br />
<br />
<i>Lam.</i> There is no other way, and though 'tis dangerous,<br />
He having servants within call, and arm'd too,<br />
Slaves fed to act all that his jealousie<br />

<i>Cler.</i> I thank you,<br />

To hate my self; to be a kind of pander,<br />

But to betray mine own throat you must pardon.<br />

Were I to hazard ten times more for you,<br />

Anabel <i>were shut, they in all fear</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>
<i>Lam.</i> O Cousin how I shake all this long night!<br />
What frights and noises we have heard, still they encrease,<br />
The villains put on shapes to torture us,<br />
And to their Devils form such preparations<br />
As if they were a hatching new dishonours,<br />
And fatal ruine, past dull mans invention.<br />
Goe not too far, and pray good Cousin <i>Anabel</i>,<br />
Hark a new noise.         <span style="margin-left: 12em;">[<i>A strange Musick. Sackbut &amp; Troop Musick.</i></span><br />
<br />
<i>Ana.</i> They are exquisite in mischief,<br />
I will goe on, this room gives no protection,<br />
More than the next, what's that? how sad and hollow,<br />
The sound comes to us.                      <span style="margin-left: 12em;">[<i>Thieves peeping. Louder.</i></span><br />
<br />
<i>Lam.</i> Groaning? or singing is it?<br />
<br />

<i>Lam.</i> Now it grows lowder, sure some sad presage<br />
Of our foul loss&mdash;look now they peep.<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
<i>Ana.</i> Till the danger feel me, thus will I talk still,<br />
And worse when that comes too; they cannot eat me.<br />
This is a punishment, upon our own prides<br />
Most justly laid; we must abuse brave Gentlemen,<br />
Make 'em tame fools, and hobby-horses, laugh and jear at<br />
Such men too, and so handsom and so Noble,<br />

Are we not women still? what were we made for?<br />

Why should we grieve and blush for? there be women,<br />

<i>Lam.</i> Which I give freely, and become a suitor,<br />
To be hereafter more familiar                       <span style="margin-left: 10em;">[<i>Kisse.</i></span><br />
With such great worth and vertue.<br />
<br />
<i>1 Gent.</i> Ever think us<br />
Your servants, Madam.<br />
<br />
<i>Cler.</i> Why if thou wilt needs know<br />
How we are freed, I will discover it,<br />
And with laconick brevity: these Gentlemen<br />
This night incountring with those outlaws that<br />
Yesterday made us prisoners, and as we were<br />
Attempted by 'em they with greater courage,<br />
(I am sure with better fortune) not alone,<br />
Guarded themselves, but forc'd the bloody thieves,<br />
Being got between them, and this hellish Cave,<br />
For safety of their lives, to fly up higher<br />
Into the woods, all left to their possession,<br />
This sav'd your Brother, and your nephew from<br />
The gibbet, this redeem'd me from my Chains,<br />
And gave my friend his liberty, this preserv'd<br />
Your honour ready to be lost.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> But that<br />
I know this for a ly, and that the thieves<br />
And gentlemen, are the same men, by my practice<br />
Suborn'd to this, he does deliver it<br />
With such a constant brow, that I am doubtfull,<br />
I should believe him too.<br />
<br />
<i>1 Gent.</i> If we did well,<br />
We are rewarded.<br />
<br />
<i>2 Gent.</i> Thanks but takes away<br />
From what was freely purpos'd.<br />
<br />
<i>Cler.</i> Now by this hand,<br />
You have so cunningly discharg'd your parts,<br />
That while we live, rest confident you shall<br />
Command <i>Dinant</i> and <i>Cleremont</i>; nor <i>Beaupre</i>,<br />
Nor <i>Verdone</i> scents it: for the Ladies, they<br />
Were easie to be gull'd.<br />
<br />
<i>1 Gent.</i> 'Twas but a jest,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>And yet the jest may chance to break our necks<br />
Should it be known.<br />
<br />
<i>Cler.</i> Fear nothing.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> <i>Cleremont</i>,<br />
Say, what success?<br />
<br />
<i>Cler.</i> As thou wouldst wish, 'tis done Lad,<br />
The grove will witness with me, that this night<br />
I lay not like a block: but how speed you?<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> I yet am in suspence, devise some means<br />
To get these off, and speedily.<br />
<br />
<i>Cler.</i> I have it,<br />
Come, we are dull, I think that the good fellows,<br />
Our predecessors in this place, were not<br />
So foolish, and improvident husbands, but<br />
'Twill yield us meat and wine.<br />
<br />
<i>1 Gent.</i> Let's ransack it,<br />
'Tis ours now by the Law.<br />
<br />
<i>Cler.</i> How say you sweet one,<br />
Have you an appetite?<br />
<br />
<i>Ana.</i> To walk again<br />
I'th' Woods, if you think fit, rather than eat.<br />
<br />
<i>Cler.</i> A little respite prethee; nay blush not,<br />
You ask but what's your own, and warrantable:<br />
<i>Monsieur</i>, <i>Beaupre</i>, <i>Verdone</i>,<br />
What think you of the motion?<br />
<br />
<i>Verd.</i> Lead the way.<br />
<br />
<i>Beau.</i> We follow willingly.      <span style="margin-left: 8em;">[<i>Ex. Man.</i> Din. <i>and</i> Lam.</span><br />
<br />
<i>Cler.</i> When you shall think fit,<br />
We will expect you.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> Now be mistris of<br />
Your promise Lady.<br />
<br />
<i>Lam.</i> 'Twas to give you hearing.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> But that word hearing, did include a grant,<br />
And you must make it good.<br />
<br />
<i>Lam.</i> Must?<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> Must and shall,<br />
I will be fool'd no more, you had your tricks;<br />
Made properties of me, and of my friend;<br />
Presum'd upon your power, and whip'd me with<br />
The rod of mine own dotage: do not flatter<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>Your self with hope, that any humane help<br />
Can free you, and for aid by miracle<br />
A base unthankfull woman is unworthy.<br />
<br />
<i>Lam.</i> You will not force me?<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> Rather than enjoy you<br />
With your consent, because I will torment you;<br />
I'le make you feel the effects of abus'd love,<br />
And glory in your torture.<br />
<br />
<i>Lam.</i> Brother, Nephew,<br />
Help, help, for Heavens sake.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> Tear your throat, cry louder,<br />
Though every leaf, these trees bear, were an Echo,<br />
And summon'd in your best friends to redeem you,<br />
It should be fruitless: 'tis not that I love you,<br />
Or value those delights you prize so high,<br />
That I'le enjoy you, a French crown will buy<br />
More sport, and a companion, to whom,<br />
You in your best trim are an Ethiop.<br />
<br />
<i>Lam.</i> Forbear me then.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> Not so, I'le do't in spite,<br />
And break that stubborn disobedient will,<br />
That hath so long held out, that boasted honour<br />
I will make equal with a common Whores;<br />
The spring of Chastity, that fed your pride,<br />
And grew into a River of vain glory,<br />
I will defile with mudd, the mudd of lust,<br />
And make it loathsome even to goats.<br />
<br />
<i>Lam.</i> O Heaven!<br />
No pity Sir?<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> You taught me to be cruel,<br />
And dare you think of mercy? I'le tell thee fool,<br />
Those that surpriz'd thee, were my instruments,<br />
I can plot too good Madam, you shall find it:<br />
And in the stead of licking of my fingers,<br />
Kneeling and whining like a boy new breech'd,<br />
To get a toy forsooth, not worth an apple,<br />
Thus make my way, and with Authority<br />
Command what I would have.<br />
<br />
<i>Lam.</i> I am lost for ever:<br />
Good Sir, I do confess my fault, my gross fault,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>And yield my self up, miserable guilty;<br />
Thus kneeling I confess, you cannot study<br />
Sufficient punishments to load me with;<br />
I am in your power, and I confess again,<br />
You cannot be too cruel: if there be,<br />
Besides the loss of my long guarded honour,<br />
Any thing else to make the ballance even,<br />
Pray put it in, all hopes, all helpes have left me;<br />
I am girt round with sorrow, hell's about me,<br />
And ravishment the least that I can look for,<br />
Do what you please.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> Indeed I will do nothing,<br />
Nor touch nor hurt you Lady, nor had ever<br />
Such a lewd purpose.<br />
<br />
<i>Lam.</i> Can there be such goodness,<br />
And in a man so injur'd?<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> Be confirm'd in't.<br />
I seal it thus: I must confess you vex'd me,<br />
In fooling me so often, and those fears<br />
You threw upon me call'd for a requital,<br />
Which now I have return'd, all unchast love<br />
<i>Dinant</i> thus throws away; live to man-kind,<br />
As you have done to me, and I will honour<br />
Your vertue, and no more think of your beauty.<br />
<br />
<i>Lam.</i> All I possess, comes short of satisfaction.<br />
<br />
<i>Din.</i> No complements: the terrours of this night<br />
Imagine but a fearfull dream, and so<br />
With ease forget it: for <i>Dinant</i>, that labour'd<br />
To blast your honour, is a Champion for it,<br />
And will protect and guard it.<br />
<br />
<i>Lam.</i> 'Tis as safe then,<br />
As if a compleat Army undertook it.               <span style="margin-left: 8em;">[<i>Exeunt.</i></span><br />
